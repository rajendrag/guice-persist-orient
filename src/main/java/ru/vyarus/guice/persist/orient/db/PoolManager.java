/**
 * Manage pool of connections for specific connection type (e.g. object connections).
 * Pool also works as connection provider, but implementation should not allow to obtain connection outside transaction
 * (unit of work).
 * <p>While transaction manager defines global unit of work scope, each pool manager defines
 * its own thread local transaction.
 * It is impossible in orient to share transaction between different connections (by design),
 * but most likely in most cases only one pool will be used
 * in transaction.</p>
 * <p>To change pool size use {@code OGlobalConfiguration.DB_POOL_MIN.setValue()} and
 * {@code OGlobalConfiguration.DB_POOL_MAX.setValue()}. By default pools it's 1-20.</p>
 * <p>Do not use global pools in implementations - always create new one to avoid possible
 * collisions with other pools</p>
 * <p>Implementation must rely on {@link ru.vyarus.guice.persist.orient.db.user.UserManager} for actual
 * user credentials.</p>
