/**
 * Base class for default pool implementations.
 * Connection may be obtained (using provider) only inside unit of work (defined transaction).
 * Because of multi-transaction paradigm inside single unit of work, transaction manager always calls
 * commit and rollback on all pools (no matter which one is really need it). Implementation handle it
 * by ignoring redundant calls: first commit or rollback finish pool transaction and all other calls
 * to commit or rollback simply ignored.
